                    Hi! I'm Andrew, an Electrical and Computer Engineering major at Carnegie Mellon University.
                I love combining technology and design to create cool things. Engineering helps build
                great new solutions, and design keeps them close and connected to us
                on an human level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This summer, I built a backend web architecture proof of concept at the NASA Jet 
                    Propulsion Laboratory to prove out a set of tools for web modernization. My work focused on 
                    facilitating canary style deployments and enhancing security.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    In my free time I enjoy designing, programming, playing, and modifying video games. I also
                like to read and watch about engineering topics like personal electronics, cars, and aircraft. 
                Outside, I like to skateboard and go target shooting. I'm always open to talking
                and meeting new people, feel free reach out to me!
                </p>
