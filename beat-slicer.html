            <p>
                When I started building Beat Slicer, I had hardly an idea for what it would be. All I knew is I wanted
                to build a game that was cool - complex enough that it's mechanisms were not obvious, accessible enough 
                to run on most personal computers, and elegant enough to be fun without a lengthy explanation of 
                the controls. One of my favorite bits of wisdom is, "if something is well-designed 
                enough, it does not need instructions to be understood."
            </p>
            <p>Guided by these goals, I started thinking about features for my game, with three priorities in mind:</p>
            <img src="images/beat-slicer-1.jpg" class="project-image">
            <p>
                The idea of a 3D music-based motion game reminded me of <i>Beat Saber</i>, a widely popular virtual reality game. 
                While super cool and very fun to play, <i>Beat Saber</i> requires a VR headset, which means most people 
                couldn't play it conveniently. Thus, I was inspired to create a PC-based game based on <i>Beat Saber</i> with
                an emphasis on being easily accessible for the average person. 
            </p>

            <span class="title subtitle">The Design</span>
            <p>Motion tracking would be the biggest design challenge for my project.</p>
            <img src="images/beat-slicer-2.jpg" class="project-image">
            <p>
                My first two ideas proved unreliable or unstable, and would not produce a working game. They also 
                heavily compromised accessibility, but I decided to focus on the first issue to at least have a 
                functioning game.
            </p>
            <p> I thought a bit about how cameras work, and realized that while a <i>reflective</i> object
                blurs into the background when moving, an <b>emissive</b> light source would create a long bright streak
                that would still be detectable. Thus, the next step was obvious:
            </p>

            <p>
                I was finally happy to have functioning camera tracking, but was also pretty unhappy that the current
                setup required players to buy some parts and wire up an electronic contraption, which meant <i>very poor
                accessibility</i>. At the same time, I made the whimsical realization that <b>any light source worked</b>
                with my tracking algorithm, and was having some fun:
