            <span class="title subtitle">The Story</span>
            <p> Fruit Slicer was created by 3 friends and me over the course of a 24-hour weekend Python hackathon. 
                The concept that we settled on was a fruit-slashing game like the mobile game Fruit Ninja, but with 
                accurate geometrical fragment slicing. A key bit of fun is that the slicing is <b>recursive</b>, so you 
                can slice a fruit into fragments, and split those fragments, and split the fragments of those fragments, on and
                on <i>infinitely</i>  many times.    
            </p>
            <p>
                A month after the hackathon, I independently developed an OpenCV-based motion input controlled version 
                of the game on a fork, 
                <a href="https://github.com/47hao/fruit-slicer-cv" target="_blank" class="fruit-link-1">available here,</a> 
                which I originally built to unit test

                camera control.
            </p>
            <span class="title subtitle">Process</span>
            <p> We divided up the tasks to make the most of our limited hackathon time, which was especially 
                suitable to our OOP-based game. Fruits, we decided, would be <b>low-poly shapes</b> with no more 
                than a dozen edges for simplicity, and together we figured out the polyhedron slicing process:
            </p>

            <p>
                Moving the halves apart was fairly simple; give each fragment a push, perpendicular to the slice
                direction's slope. This did result in some weird behavior with <i>perfectly vertical</i> slices,
                as they would result in a <b> divide by zero</b>. We were pretty tight on time, so we hardcoded 
                a catch for this edge case, and to our knowledge, nobody was able to make an exact pixel-perfect vertical cut.
                Next, we translated the math into <b>actual methods in code</b>. After several hours of debugging, we had
                a reliable slicing demo.
            </p>

            <p>
                We began this project with just the idea of polyhedral slicing, so I started writing code for a 
                "fruit fragment" object. Understandably, the code for movement and drawing a fragment was <i>very similar</i> 
                to that of a whole fruit, and we realized: <b>what if a sliced fruit simply
                created two more "fruit" objects instead?</b> 
            </p>

            <p>
                The fragments thus could be sliced just like the whole fruits, and this gave us the fantastically 
                fun ability to turn fruit into little shreds of confetti.
